                     Any cancellation must be communicated in writing via email to the relevant conference secretary and cite reasons for the cancellation, such as illness, inability to secure funds, or any other personal issues. The notification must contain all necessary details regarding the bank account that could potentially receive a refund (incl. IBAN and BIC). Prior to receiving a formal acknowledgement from the relevant conference secretary, the cancellation will not take effect.

                    <p>
                    Due to upfront payments made for the venue, printing, shipping, hotels, and other expenses, we must maintain the refund policy.

                    </p>
                    <h2>Policy as Follows:</h2>
                    <p>
                      Written cancellation received:

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>75% refund up to 60 days before the conference.</li>
                      <li>25% refund between 60 and 30 days before the conference.</li>
                      <li>30 days beforeÂ the conference: There is no return for the registration and lodging costs.</li>
                      <li>Non-refundable for electronic posters and video presentations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    Refund requests will be evaluated based on the email receipt date. Refunds will be given following the summit or conference. Refund requests for excess payments or multiple payments must be submitted in writing to the conference secretary.

                    </p>
                    <p>No refunds will be given for unattended summits, speaker cancellations, room shortages, or any other issues that occur during the summit that are out of the conference's or summit's organisers' control. Participants acknowledge that through registering for the conference or summit, neither the organising committee nor the event will be held liable in any way.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Refunds will be made in the following ways:</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>For payments made with a credit card or debit card, the original card will be credited or debited.</li>
                      <li>All bank fees for all other payments will be charged to the registrant's account and will be transferred to the payee's designated account.</li>
                      <li><b>Note:</b> If your application for a visa is denied, you may transfer the money you have already paid to another conference of your choosing. Refunds are not available to participants who received reductions on their registration fees. Unless the event is postponed. </li>
                      <li>Conference/Summit Postponement/Cancellation: The congress organisers will refund 100% of registration fees in the event that the congress cannot be held or must be postponed due to circumstance(s) beyond the control of the Conference/Summit organisers, or due to events that are not the result of their wilful misconduct or gross negligence. However, they cannot be held responsible by participants for any damages, costs, or losses incurred, such as travel expenses, flight cancellation fees, or lodging costs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Transfer Policy:</h2>
                    <p>
                      Only if a participant has a valid excuse for their absence may they transfer a fully paid registration to one of the organization's other related conferences. Transfer requests can only be made via email. If a registered participant is replaced, the new participant's full name, contact information (phone number, email address), presentation abstract, and title must be given to the appropriate conference secretary. However, if it is not informed one month before the conference, the registration fee cannot be changed. Only one conference can get a registered fee transfer; refunds are not available.
